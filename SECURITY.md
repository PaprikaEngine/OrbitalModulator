```

### Sandbox Security Features
- **CPU Usage Limits**: 5% default, configurable per plugin
- **Memory Limits**: 64MB default, enforced allocation tracking
- **File System Isolation**: Whitelist-based access control
- **Network Restrictions**: Optional, domain-based filtering
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Violation detection and auto-disable

## 🛠️ Security Implementation Details

### Plugin Verification
```rust
// Cryptographic verification of plugin integrity
pub struct PluginVerifier {
    pub signature_check: bool,     // Ed25519 signatures
    pub hash_verification: bool,   // SHA256 checksums
    pub certificate_chain: bool,   // Developer certificates
}
```

### Resource Monitoring
```rust
// Real-time resource tracking
pub struct ResourceMonitor {
    cpu_usage: f32,           // Current CPU usage (0.0-1.0)
    memory_peak: usize,       // Peak memory usage in bytes
    file_operations: u64,     // Number of file I/O operations
    network_requests: u64,    // Network connection attempts
}
```

### Permission System
```rust
// Granular permission control
pub enum Permission {
    FileRead { path: String },        // Read access to specific paths
    FileWrite { path: String },       // Write access to specific paths
    Network { domains: Vec<String> }, // Network access to domains
    Audio,                           // Audio device access
    Midi,                           // MIDI device access
}
```

## 🚫 Security Restrictions

### Prohibited Plugin Operations
- **Direct Memory Access**: No unsafe pointer operations
- **System Calls**: Restricted to audio-related APIs
- **Network Access**: Disabled by default, explicit whitelist required
- **File System**: Sandbox-restricted, no system file access
- **Process Spawning**: Completely prohibited
- **DLL Injection**: Blocked through C ABI isolation

### Automatic Security Responses
```rust
// Violation handling
match violation_type {
    ViolationType::CpuExceeded => suspend_plugin(),
    ViolationType::MemoryExceeded => limit_allocation(),
    ViolationType::UnauthorizedFileAccess => revoke_permission(),
    ViolationType::MaliciousBehavior => quarantine_plugin(),
}
```

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Real-time Violation Tracking**: Every plugin operation monitored
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU/Memory usage logged
- **Security Events**: Timestamp, severity, and context recorded
- **Audit Logs**: Tamper-proof event logging

### Security Metrics
```rust
pub struct SecurityMetrics {
    total_violations: u64,
    critical_violations: u64,
    plugins_quarantined: u64,
    uptime_seconds: u64,
}
```

## 🧪 Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests
- **Fuzzing**: Plugin input validation
- **Sandbox Escape Tests**: Privilege escalation attempts
- **Resource Exhaustion**: DoS resistance testing
- **Memory Safety**: Use-after-free, buffer overflow detection

### Manual Security Reviews
- **Code Audits**: Static analysis of plugin system
- **Penetration Testing**: Third-party security assessments
- **Threat Modeling**: Attack vector analysis

## 🏗️ Secure Development Practices

### Memory Safety
- **Rust Safety**: Memory-safe core implementation
- **C ABI Boundaries**: Careful unsafe block management
- **Bounds Checking**: All array/buffer accesses validated
- **RAII Patterns**: Automatic resource cleanup

### Input Validation
```rust
// All plugin inputs validated
fn validate_plugin_input(input: &PluginInput) -> Result<(), SecurityError> {
    if input.buffer_size > MAX_BUFFER_SIZE {
        return Err(SecurityError::BufferTooLarge);
    }
    if input.sample_rate < MIN_SAMPLE_RATE || input.sample_rate > MAX_SAMPLE_RATE {
        return Err(SecurityError::InvalidSampleRate);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### Cryptographic Security
- **Hash Functions**: SHA256 for integrity verification
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for plugin authentication
- **Secure Random**: Platform-specific CSPRNG for session keys
- **Certificate Validation**: X.509 certificate chain verification

## 📋 Security Compliance

### Industry Standards
- **OWASP**: Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- **NIST**: Cybersecurity Framework compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration mitigation

### Privacy Protection
